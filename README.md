# image_processing_tasks
Image Processing, Computer Vision and Advanced Video Processing Algorithms. Semesters 9 and 10

This is a collection of Image Processing and Computer Vision tasks and mini-projects that tackle different areas and algorithms. 

Algorithms in Computer Vision include but are not limited to calculating Integral Image and Local Sum Calculation, Kernel Convolution, and applying several filters. 

Algorithms in Image Processing include but are not limited to distance transform algorithm, SIFT algorithm, and shadow detection and reduction. 

They are written in Python and MATLAB.

All work done using the help of Google and websites such as Stack Overflow etc.
